Does the organization perform regular vulnerability and misconfiguration scans?

DEFINTIION:

Identify, report, and correct information system flaws in a timely manner.

DISCUSSION:

Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this 
information to designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. 
Organizations address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take 
advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in remediating flaws discovered in 
organizational systems. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including the criticality 
of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types of remediation. 
NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on patch management technologies.

CLARIFICATION:

All software and firmware have potential flaws. Many vendors work to reduce those flaws by releasing vulnerability information and updates to their software and firmware. 
Organizations should have a process to review relevant vendor newsletters with updates about common problems or weaknesses. After reviewing the information the organization 
should execute a process called patch management that allows for systems to be updated without adversely affecting the organization. Organizations should also purchase support 
from their vendors to ensure timely access to updates.

EXAMPLE:

You have many responsibilities at your company, including IT. You know that malware, ransomware, and viruses can be a big problem for companies. You make sure to enable all 
security updates for your software, including the operating system and applications, and purchase the maintenance packages for new hardware and operating systems.
