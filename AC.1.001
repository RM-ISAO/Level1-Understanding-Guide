Does the organization list approved users, services, and devices?  Are logical controls in place to prevent the unauthorized use of the system?


DEFINITION:

Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other information systems).

DISCUSSION:

Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects 
(i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and domains) in systems. 
Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security. Other systems include 
systems internal and external to the organization. This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition of and 
enforcement of access authorizations, other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses non-privileged) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2 (AC.1.002).

CLARIFICATION:


Control who can use company computers and who can log on to the company network.  Limit the services and devices, like printers, that can be accessed by company computers. 
Set up your system so that unauthorized users and devices cannot get on the company network.



EXAMPLE #1:

You are in charge of IT for your company. You give a username and password to every employee who uses a company computer for their job. No one can use a company computer 
without a username and a password. You give a username and password only to those employees you know have permission to be on the system. When an employee leaves the company, 
you disable their username and password immediately.
