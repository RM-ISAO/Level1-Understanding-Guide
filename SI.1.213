Does the organization perform periodic (e.g. daily/weekly) antivirus scans and have "real-time protection" enabled?

DEFINITION:

Perform periodic scans of information systems and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed.

DISCUSSION:

Periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats
(e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in 
a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of 
system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. Many technologies and methods exist to
limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, 
and other types of cyberattacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. 
In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and 
monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended.

CLARIFICATION:

Companies should use anti-malware software to scan and identify viruses in their computer systems, and have a plan for how often scans are conducted. Real-time scans will look 
at the system whenever new files are downloaded, opened, and saved. Periodic scans check previously saved files against updated malware information.

EXAMPLE:

While cleaning up your office, you find your old thumb drive. You are not sure if you should use it. Then you remember something: Your company just purchased anti-malware 
software that auto-updates with the latest antivirus code and definitions of all known malware. With this in mind, you decide to plug in the thumb drive. The new anti-malware 
software scans the thumb drive, finds a virus, then deletes the file.
