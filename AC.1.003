Does the organization list approved connections between internal and external systems?  This includes user-initiated connections such as file sharing and limiting the use of 
those connections.

DEFINITION:

Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information systems.

DISCUSSION:

External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements
and controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and
privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing,
storage, or transmission of Federally Contracted Information, including accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a 
service) from organizational systems. Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and 
procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum, the types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems. If terms and conditions
with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. This requirement
recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those situations,
organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification 
that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the assurance or
confidence level required by organizations. Note that while "external" typically refers to outside of the organization's direct supervision and authority, that is not always 
the case. Regarding the protection of Federally Contracted Information across an organization, the organization may have systems that process Federally Contracted Information 
and others that do not. And among the systems that process Federally Contracted Information there are likely access restrictions for Federally Contracted Information that apply 
between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered "external" to that system.

CLARIFICATION:

Make sure to control and manage connections between your company network and outside networks, such as the public internet or a network that does not belong to your company.
Be aware of applications that can be run by outside systems. Control and limit personal devices like laptops, tablets, and phones from accessing the company networks and 
information. You can also choose to limit how and when your network is connected to outside systems and/or decide that only certain employees can connect to outside systems 
from network resources.

EXAMPLE: 

You help manage IT for your employer. You and your coworkers are working on a big proposal, and all of you will put in extra hours over the weekend to get it done. Part of 
the proposal includes Federal Contract Information, or FCI. FCI is information that you or your company get from doing work for the Federal government. Because FCI is not 
shared publicly, you remind your coworkers to use their company laptops, not personal laptops or tablets, when working on the proposal over the weekend.
