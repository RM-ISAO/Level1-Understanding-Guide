Does the organization define approved us cases for controllable unclassified information? (i.e. "We get it from here, process it here, and send it there.")  Does the organization
control the flow of this information with technologies such as firewalls, account based permissions etc.? 

DEFINITION:

Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems.

DISCUSSION:

In accordance with laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or standards, the public is not authorized access to nonpublic information 
(e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act, CUI, and proprietary information). This requirement addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible 
to the public, typically without identification or authentication. Individuals authorized to post CUI onto publicly accessible systems are designated. The content of information 
is reviewed prior to posting onto publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic information is not included.
(DISCUSSION SOURCE: DRAFT NIST SP 800-171 R2)

CLARIFICATION:

Do not allow sensitive information, including Federal Contract Information (FCI), which may include CUI, to become public. It is important to know which users/employees 
are allowed to publish information on publicly accessible systems, like your company website. Limit and control information that is posted on your company's website(s) that 
can be accessed by the public.

EXAMPLE: 

You are head of marketing for your company and want to become better known by your customers. So, you decide to start issuing press releases about your company projects. Your
company gets FCI from doing work for the Federal government. FCI is information that is not shared publicly. Because you recognize the need to control sensitive information, 
including FCI, you carefully review all information before posting it on the company website or releasing to the public. You allow only certain employees to post to the website.
