Does the organization have antivirus installed at various locations?

DEFINITION:

Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems.

DISCUSSION:

Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may include firewalls, remote access servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, 
notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, 
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways
including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system
vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to 
limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of 
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, 
and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. 
In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and
monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on malware incident prevention.

CLARIFICATION:

You can protect your company's valuable IT system by stopping malicious code at designated locations in your system. Malicious code is program code that purposefully creates an
unauthorized function or process that will have a negative impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system. A designated location may be your 
network device or your computer. Malicious code includes the following, which can be hidden in email, email attachments, web access: viruses, programs designed to damage, steal 
information, change data, send email, show messages, or any combination of these things; spyware, a program designed to gather information about a person's activity in secret, 
and is usually installed without the person knowing when they click on a link; and a trojan horse, a type of malware made to look like legitimate/real software, and used by cyber
criminals to get access to a company's systems. By using anti-malware tools, you can stop or lessen the impact of malicious code.

EXAMPLE:

You are buying a new computer for your small business and want to protect your company's information from viruses, spyware, etc. You buy and install anti-malware software.
