Does the organization update antivirus software and signatures regularly?

DEFINITION:

Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available.

DISCUSSION:

Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate
the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. 
In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of 
cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations,
organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices 
to help ensure that software does not perform functions other.

CLARIFICATION:

You can protect your company's valuable IT systems by staying up to date on new security releases that stop malicious code and monitoring the system regularly. Malicious code 
is program code that is always changing, so it is important to always have up-to-date protections, such as anti-malware tools.

EXAMPLE:

You bought a new computer for your small business. You know that you need to protect your company's information from viruses, spyware, etc. So, you also purchased and installed 
antimalware software. You configure the software to automatically update to the latest antivirus code and definitions of all known malware.
