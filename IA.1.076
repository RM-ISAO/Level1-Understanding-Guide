Does the organization require user acccounts to logon to system components?

DEFINITION:

Identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices.

DISCUSSION:

Common device identifiers include media access control (MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual identifiers is not
applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the user names associated with the system accounts assigned to those individuals. Organizations may 
require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity. In addition, this requirement addresses individual 
identifiers that are not necessarily associated with system accounts. Organizational devices requiring identification may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination 
of type/device. NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities.

CLARIFICATION:

Authentication helps you to know who is using or viewing your system. Make sure to assign individual, unique identifiers, like user names, to all employees/users who access 
company systems. Confirm the identities of users, processes, or devices before allowing them access to the company's information system-usually done through passwords.

EXAMPLE:

You lead a project with the Department of Defense (DoD) for your small company and want to make sure that all employees working on the project can log on to the company system
to see important information about the project. You also want to prevent employees who are not working on the DoD project from being able to access the information. You set up 
the system so that when an employee logs on, the system uniquely identifies each person, then determines the appropriate level of access.
